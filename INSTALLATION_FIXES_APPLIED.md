# Installation Fixes and Improvements Applied

## üîß **Critical Fixes Discovered During GitHub Repository Testing**

During comprehensive testing of the clean repository, we identified and resolved several installation issues that are now included in the repository for seamless installation.

### **1. Python 3.13 Compatibility Issues**

**Problem:** Some packages in requirements.txt are not compatible with Python 3.13+
- `kokoro>=0.9.2` requires Python <3.13
- Several other packages have build issues with Python 3.13

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `kokoro>=0.9.2` to `kokoro>=0.7.16` (Python 3.13 compatible)
- Created `requirements-py313-compatible.txt` for Python 3.13 users
- Added automatic Python version detection in installation scripts

### **2. Missing Dependencies in requirements.txt**

**Problem:** Some core dependencies were missing from the requirements.txt file:
- `crontab` (required for task scheduling)
- `inputimeout` (required for user input handling)
- `flaredantic` (required for tunnel management)
- `requests` (required for HTTP operations)
- `openai` (required for OpenAI API)

**Fix Applied:**
- Added all missing dependencies to requirements.txt
- Created dependency validation script that checks for missing packages
- Auto-installer now detects and installs missing dependencies

### **3. Path Resolution Issues**

**Problem:** Some installations fail due to path resolution problems
- `/a0/` path mapping not properly configured
- Working directory conflicts during installation

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced path resolution in `python/helpers/files.py`
- Added automatic working directory detection
- Created path validation during installation

### **4. Security Hardening**

**Problem:** Hardcoded secrets were present in the codebase
- GitHub tokens in `python/tools/github_tool.py`
- API keys in configuration files

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed all hardcoded secrets from git history
- Replaced with environment variable placeholders
- Added security validation to prevent future commits with secrets

### **5. Installation Validation**

**Problem:** No way to verify if installation was successful
- Missing post-installation tests
- No validation of core functionality

**Fix Applied:**
- Created comprehensive installation test (`test_installation.py`)
- Added dependency validation scripts
- Created health check endpoints
